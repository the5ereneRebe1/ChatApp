  :zap: Are you trying to chat with your friends but want to stay anonymous? <br/>
  :zap: Do you want the applicaiton to run anywhere? <br/>
  :zap: Are you tired of logging in and doing user authentication. <br/>
  :zap: A chat App is here for you build with technologies like **React, Socket.io, Node.js**? <br/>

***We have a solution!***

ChatApp is an app build for this purpose. You can create rooms as you go and invite your friends to join the room. <br/> No messages are saved on the server and unlike other chat Apps we d not maintain user sessions.
